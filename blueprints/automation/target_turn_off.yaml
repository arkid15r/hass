  description: |
    Turns Off Idle Target.

    The automation periodically checks for activity in the target area and loads a specific scene to turn off the target if no activity has been detected for a specified amount of time.

    Inputs:
      - **Check Frequency** (*default*: /1, *unit*: minutes): how often (in minutes) to check whether the `Target` is idle.
      - **Target**: an entity with 'on'/'off' state capability which needs to be turned off.
      - **Target Active Time** (*default*: 0, *unit*: seconds): a minimum amount of time the `Target` is required to be in 'on' state at the moment of the check.
      - **Watcher**: (*optional*) an entity with 'on'/'off' state capability which tracks activity in the `Target` area. If no activity detected by the `Watcher` for at least `Watcher Idle Time` the `Target` will be considered idle.
      - **Watcher Inactive Time** (*default*: 0, *unit*: seconds): an amount of time without any activity detected by the `Watcher` required to consider the `Target` idle.
      - **Scene**: a scene that turns the idle `Target` off.
      - **Run If Only** (*optional*): run the automation if the entity is in a required state (see the `Run If Only State`) only.
      - **Run If Only State** (*default: off*): a state ('on'/'off') in which the `Run If Only` entity must be to run the automation. If no `Run If Only` entity provided the `Run If Only State` is ignored.
